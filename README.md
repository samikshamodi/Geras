# Geras - Connecting elderly to the care they deserve
Our application “Geras” allows senior citizens and their families, NGOs, the government and other volunteers to connect and build a network. The government will be registered as an owner and administrator as they will assign officers and also fund the application while ensuring the smooth working of the services. NGOs will be registered as agencies partnering with the government on our application which will help in providing the services by assigning volunteers. On the other hand, the senior citizens, who are the beneficiary of our application, will be registered as users and the app will allow them to connect and avail the offered services without any hassle. In order to eliminate the concern of the families of the senior citizens, our application also serves as a portal for the families to get updates about the services the senior citizen requests and ensure their well being. Adding to this, our application will be open to any volunteer who wishes to join and help us improve our services by suggesting new innovative ideas.

## Stakeholders
### The Elderly  
We presently have the largest population of youth and that is the bedrock of our future. However, we are soon also going to have perhaps the largest population of the elderly and get the label of a Geriatric Nation. But these elderlies have been the backbone of our nation and we must ensure that it remains strong - physically as well as mentally. We the young people and the government must now help them in their sensitive phase, providing them the care and comfort to lead a healthy and dignified life without worries and anxiety. 

The elderly can easily connect to services that the government and the NGOs provide through our application.

Volunteering holds a very important role in a community as it helps in holding the community together. Hence, our application is not only limited to registered members, but it is also open for volunteers. With their enthusiasm, the volunteers can be a helping hand for the elderly.

### NGOs   
A non governmental organization (NGO) is a non profit that functions independently of any government, so as to serve a social or political goal such as humanitarian causes or environment. NGOs are instrumental in the social development of a state, nation or community. They act as a common link between government, families, volunteers and senior citizens. Through our application, the NGOs can effectively organize and execute their data and functions respectively, thereby amplifying their reach.

The NGOs can employ our database in order to fulfill the services required by the elderly by assigning volunteers to them. Besides, they can also request medical check-up for the elderly in the nearest government hospital because the government is also one of the stakeholders. The NGOs can even interact with the families of the elderly and discuss the further measures in order to maximize the well-being of elderly (feedback from families).

The government plays a very important role in connecting the Elderly, NGO and it’s officers. The government will serve as a supervisor and administrator as they will assign officers and also fund the application while ensuring the smooth working of the services. They are responsible for keeping a check on all the services.

Healthcare workers play a very vital role in our daily lives. They save lives but their importance goes far beyond that. They make a difference by helping patients minimize pain, recover from a disease faster or learn to live with a disabling injury. The profession of a doctor is the most noble and respected one. They do a great service to society.
